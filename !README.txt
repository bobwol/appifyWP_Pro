APPIFYWP PRO INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


1) Install WordPress

  - If you have a shared hosting plan, there's a good chance they offer a "one-click-install" script. This makes installing WordPress and getting things setup very easy.
  
  - If the above isn't an option and you'd like to go the manual route, this guide will help: 
  http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress
  
  
2) Login to your WordPress site (wp-admin)

  - yourdomain.com/wp-admin/
  
3) Go to Appearance > Themes > Install Themes > Upload

  - Select the appifyWP_pro.zip from your hard drive
  
4) Activate AppifyWP Pro

5) Visit your site and follow the Getting Started guide

TROUBLESHOOTING

- If you dont see the getting started guide, go to wp-admin > Appearance > Reading, then make sure that "Your latest posts" is selected, and press save.

- If your AppifyWP Pro settings aren't working, ensure you have at least WordPress 3.5 installed


TIPS & NOTES 

- If you're adding AppifyWP to an existing site, it's highly recommended that you always backup your WordPress site (files and database) before activating a new theme or making updates.

- All data entered in the AppifyWP Pro Settings page are stored in your local WordPress database, so when you upgrade to future versions of AppifyWP Pro, you can do so non-destructively. 

- Read this post on keeping your WordPress installation secure:

APPIFYWP UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS

IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTE: If you've made any customizations to the theme source files (*.php, *.css, *.js), your changes will not be in the upgraded version. You will have to fetch your changes from the old version and bring them into the new version.

ALSO: It's always a good idea to backup your site and theme files before an upgrade, just in case.

- If you are upgrading to a newer version of AppifyWP Pro, you need to delete the old version, then re-install the update as stated in step 3 above.

- All of your AppifyWP Pro settings and Apps will carry over to the new version.


DEMO SITE IMPORT

If you'd like to make your site look like http://prodemo.appifywp.com as a starting point, you can import the Demo XML file (!Demo_Data_AppifyWP_Prov1.xml) into your WordPress site via wp-admin > Tools > Import.

Then, go to wp-admin > AppifyWP Pro Settings > Advanced, and scroll down to the "Import Options" field at the bottom, and copy/paste the string found in !Demo-Settings.txt into that field, then hit save.
